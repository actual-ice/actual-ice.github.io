        Wow, we've been together for three years already. For me, I feel like it went by like a blink of an eye, and my memories with you in Kisay feel more like a dream. I remember when I first met you IRL. I could not stop staring at you and admiring how pretty you were. Your voice was beautiful, your kindness was infectious, and your confidence was.. hot. Even now, I wonder what I did to deserve you. Why did you have to make me miss you so much? But I take comfort knowing that we will eventually meet again. Thank you for everything baby. Thank you for making me feel so loved and so safe. Thank you for all the little things that you do, like sending me videos talking about your day. Those little things make me feel like the luckiest man in the world. Words cannot describe what I feel for you. I love you. I love you more than I can say. I love you. Here's a little token of appreciation <3.
